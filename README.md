## Code in Bash programming language that utilizes a simple adblock mechanism using iptables.

Folder contains:

* adblock.sh
"Contains the Bash code used for utilizing the Tool.
To display tool usage use: $ ./adblock.sh -help "


 Some ads have disappeared, although there are a lot that persist. The reasons for this are:
 
1. That the Rules that we have created only take into acount the domains that we have given which are definitely not all there is for ads.

2. The fact that the ips that the host command returned, which are used to form the iptables Rules, are the ones for that given time(not absolute).
