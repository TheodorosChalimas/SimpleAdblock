#README for assignment 7, course HPY414.

Code in Bash programming language that utilizes a simple adblock mechanism using iptables.

Folder contains:

	-adblock.sh
  "Contains the Bash code used for utilizing the Tool.
  To display tool usage use: $ ./adblock.sh -help "

Answer to question posed in assignment:
 Most ads have disappeared, although there are some that persist. The reasons for this are:
  - That the Rules that we have created only take into amount the
  domains that we have given which are definitely not all there is for ads.
  - The fact that the ips that the host command returned, which are used to form the iptables Rules,
  are the ones for that given time(not absolute).

There are comments on the code for further code explanation where needed.
